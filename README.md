## Project Description

This RESTful API application enables users to manage web shops and their products. It provides secure user authentication through JWT-based token access, and itâ€™s designed for easy scalability with Docker and Docker Compose. Users can create, view, and manage shops and products, all stored in a PostgreSQL database with caching and asynchronous capabilities.

## Key Features
- JWT Authentication: Secure login with token-based access control
- User Registration and Login: Easy account management with token refreshing
- Database Caching: Redis for efficient data caching
- Asynchronous Tasks: Background task processing
- SQLAlchemy & Pydantic: Database ORM and data validation
- Alembic Migrations: Manage database schema changes
- Middleware Support: Customizable middleware for request handling
- Comprehensive Documentation
- Dockerized Deployment: Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- Permissions: Access control for users


## Main functionality
1. Shop Management
    - Create a new shop
    - View all shops
    - Access only the shops related to the current user
    - View shop details, including a list of products within it
      
2. Product Management
    - Add products to specific shops
    - Delete products from your shops
    - Bulk upload products (e.g., from an Excel file) with asynchronous processing
    - Filter products by availability
    - Retrieve product details by ID

3. User Authentication and Authorization
    - Registration: New users can register with a username and password
    - Login: Users receive access and refresh tokens upon logging in
    - Token Refresh: Renew access tokens with a valid refresh token
